Yesterday was day one on learning rails, and all I can muster up, all I can fathom is _wow... what... magic!_. I thought the dark arts of JS was beyond comprehension, but Rails... I mean it literally populates a lot of the files and folders you need to create an app for you! Now that's magic! I do not have a complete comprehension of all things Rails, I don't even feel moderately comfortable with it as of yet. In fact I would feel more comfortable going back on stage with Sinatra, simply because I know all of the files and folders that I have created, and I created them myself, not by magic!

Another thought, why so many HTML pages? All of the apps I've developed with Sinatra are single pages with modals serving as additional "pages," which I thought made my app more functional, because then it does not send out so many requests to the server. ??? How do I dos? Also how does a Rails app connect to an API? How can a make a Rails app do all of the same things that my Sinatra apps did? I have never been more excited to LEARN!

Well class is about to start... I am so hype to learn what all my peers discovered through last nights assignment! I am going to share testing with Rails using minitests (thank you Michael Hartl & Rails Tutorial)!

More on the Rails talk later!
