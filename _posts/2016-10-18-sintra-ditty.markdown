Yesterday was day one on learning rails, and all I can muster up, all I can fathom is *wow, what is this magic?*.  I thought the dark arts of JS was beyond comprehension, but Rails... I mean it literally populates a lot of the files and folders you need to create an app for you! Now that's magic!  I do not have a complete comprehension of all things Rails, I don't even feel moderately comfortable with it as of yet. In fact I would feel more comfortable going back on stage with Sinatra, simply because I know all of the files and folders that I have created, and I created them myself, not magic!

Another thought, why so many HTML pages? All of the apps I've developed with Sinatra are single pages with modals serving as additional "pages," which I thought made my app more functional, because then it does not send out so many requests to the server. ??? How do I dos?

Well class is about to start... I am so hype to learn what all my peers discovered through last nights assignment! I am going to share testing with Rails using mintests (thank you Mark Hartl & Rails Tutorial)!

More on the Rails talk later!
